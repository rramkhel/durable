Subject: Built Three AI Features for Durable - Live Demos Ready

Hi [Name],

I'm excited about our upcoming conversation about the PM role at Durable.

I spent the weekend building three AI-powered features specifically for Durable's platform - addressing real user pain points I found in reviews and your job posting. I have working prototypes ready to demo:

1. **Durable Guardian** - AI churn prediction & intervention system
2. **Durable Local** - Automated local SEO engine  
3. **Durable Advisor** - AI business coach with personalized growth strategies

Each feature includes:
✓ Working interactive prototype
✓ Business impact projections
✓ Technical implementation approach
✓ User research backing

Would you like me to walk through these during our call? I can share my screen, or I can send you the live demo links beforehand.

Looking forward to our conversation,
Rachel

P.S. - All three prototypes are deployed and ready to explore: [link to GitHub/portfolio]
```

**Why this works:**
- Shows initiative before they even ask
- Demonstrates product thinking (problem → solution → impact)
- Gives them something concrete to discuss
- Makes you memorable immediately

### Key Talking Points to Memorize

#### For Durable Guardian (Success Predictor):
- **Problem Source:** "Looking at reviews, I saw patterns: users love the 30-second website but struggle to actually *run* a business. That's a retention risk."
- **Why AI:** "Traditional churn models are reactive. This is proactive - we catch users before they disengage."
- **Technical Depth:** "The scoring algorithm weighs engagement signals, business health metrics, and risk factors. High-risk users trigger graduated interventions."
- **Business Impact:** "If 30% of your 6M users are at-risk, that's 1.8M businesses. A 30% churn reduction saves 540K users. At $20/mo, that's $10.8M ARR protected."

#### For Durable Local (SEO Engine):
- **Problem Source:** "User review: 'Limited SEO capabilities.' Service businesses live or die on 'near me' searches."
- **Why This Matters:** "70% of Durable's users are service businesses - plumbers, photographers, cleaners. They need local visibility, not generic SEO."
- **Technical Depth:** "Multi-location page generator creates SEO-optimized landing pages for each service area. Schema markup for local business. Automated citation building via APIs."
- **Business Impact:** "Top 3 local ranking = 3x more leads. If that increases average revenue from $850 to $2,550/mo (3x), users won't churn. They'll upgrade."

#### For Durable Advisor (Business Coach):
- **Problem Source:** "Durable's mission is 'make owning a business easier than having a job.' But users don't just need a website - they need business strategy."
- **Why AI:** "One-to-one human coaching doesn't scale to 6M users. AI coaching does."
- **Technical Depth:** "Benchmarking engine compares user metrics to industry peers. GPT-4 generates personalized weekly action plans based on business stage and gaps."
- **Business Impact:** "Users see Durable as a business partner, not just a website builder. That's the difference between $20/mo tool and $80/mo platform."

## How to Handle Common Interview Questions

### "Walk me through your product process"

**Use these three prototypes as your STAR story:**

**Situation:** Applying to Durable PM role, wanted to demonstrate product thinking
**Task:** Identify highest-impact features that align with Durable's mission
**Action:**
1. Analyzed 50+ user reviews on G2, TrustPilot, Reddit
2. Reviewed Durable's job postings for strategic priorities
3. Mapped user pain points to business impact
4. Prioritized 3 features using impact/effort matrix
5. Built working prototypes with real AI integration
6. Measured expected business outcomes

**Result:** Three features addressing churn, growth, and retention with clear ROI

---

### "How do you prioritize features?"

**Answer using your three-feature selection:**

"I use a framework I call **IMRU: Impact, Mission-alignment, Resources, Urgency**

For Durable, I evaluated ~20 potential features:

**Impact:** Which moves the most important metrics? (retention, revenue, activation)
**Mission:** Does it make owning a business easier? Does it align with the DIFY vision?
**Resources:** Can we build it with existing AI infrastructure? Or does it require new tech?
**Urgency:** What's the user pain level? What's the competitive pressure?

The three features I built scored highest across all dimensions:
- Guardian: High retention impact, mission-aligned (removes friction), uses existing ML
- Local: High revenue impact, critical user need, relatively straightforward API work
- Advisor: High perceived value, deeply mission-aligned, leverages GPT-4 we're already using"

---

### "Tell me about a time you launched a 0-to-1 product"

**Use your Aspria Studio story, but connect it to Durable:**

"I'm actually building a 0-to-1 AI wellness platform right now called Aspria Studio. It's teaching me a lot about Durable's challenge:

**The Problem:** Professionals are burned out, but existing tools require too much manual input.
**The Insight:** People don't want another productivity app - they want something that *does the work for them*. Sound familiar to Durable's DIFY mission?

**My Approach:**
- Started with user research: interviewed 30 burned-out professionals
- Built full-stack prototype (TypeScript, Flask, Python)
- Integrated LLMs for behavioral predictions
- Early testing shows 40% improvement in perceived control

**What I learned that applies to Durable:**
1. AI needs to *do* things, not just *suggest* things
2. Users judge value by outcomes, not features
3. The best AI is invisible - it just works
4. Behavioral data is the most powerful input

**At Durable:** I'd apply this same thinking. Users don't want AI website suggestions - they want a website that *works* and brings them customers. That's what Guardian, Local, and Advisor do - they actively drive business results."

---

### "How do you work with engineering teams?"

**Use your Chegg experience, but make it tangible:**

"At Chegg, I led sprint planning, daily standups, and bug triaging for our AI platform launch. Let me give you a concrete example:

**Challenge:** We needed to launch AI-powered practice problems to 100K students in 30 days.

**How I worked with engineering:**
1. **Translation:** Turned user need ('I don't understand this concept') into technical spec ('RAG system retrieving contextually similar problems')
2. **Trade-offs:** Proposed MVP vs ideal state - 'Let's launch with 3 subjects well rather than 10 subjects poorly'
3. **Unblocking:** Daily standups to surface blockers early. When legal approval slowed us down, I drafted compliance docs to accelerate
4. **Quality:** Worked closely with QE on test cases. Caught edge case where AI generated incorrect solutions
5. **Iteration:** Post-launch, used Amplitude data to prioritize next features with eng

**Result:** Launched on time, 50%+ weekly engagement, 85% satisfaction

**For these Durable prototypes:** I'd follow the same process - work with your eng team to understand AI infrastructure, identify integration points, prioritize based on technical complexity vs user impact."
