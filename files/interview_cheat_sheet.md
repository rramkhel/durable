## Questions to Ask Them

### Product Strategy:
"How does Durable currently measure user success beyond website creation?"

### Technical:
"What does your AI infrastructure look like? How are you using LLMs today?"

### Process:
"How do you balance building new features vs improving existing ones?"

### Team:
"What does the product team structure look like? How do PMs collaborate?"

### Vision:
"Where do you see Durable in 3 years? Still website-first or full business platform?"

---

## Handling Common Objections

### "Too complex to build"
"They leverage your existing AI infrastructure. Guardian = basic ML scoring. Local = API integrations. Advisor = GPT-4 prompts. The complexity is in product thinking, not technical implementation."

### "No resources for three features"
"Start with Guardian - protects existing revenue, minimal infrastructure, generates data for others. MVP in 6-8 weeks."

### "How do you know users want this?"
"Validated via 50+ reviews, your job posting priorities, competitor analysis. Would validate further with user interviews, surveys, analytics, beta testing if I joined."

### "We're focused on other priorities"
"Understood - these are just examples of my thinking. What are your top priorities? I can apply this same approach to those."

---

## Your Unique Edge

### What Makes You Different:
✅ **Full-stack capability** - Built actual working prototypes, not mockups  
✅ **AI/ML depth** - Chegg AI experience + building Aspria Studio  
✅ **Business impact focus** - Every feature ties to revenue/retention  
✅ **User research driven** - Started with real user pain points  
✅ **Durable-specific** - Not generic PM work, tailored to their mission

### Your Story in 3 Sentences:
"I'm a Senior PM with 6+ years in AI-driven EdTech and SaaS. At Chegg, I launched AI products to 100K+ users with 63% conversion boost. I'm passionate about using AI to genuinely help people succeed - not just build features - which is why Durable's DIFY mission resonates so strongly."

## The "Why Durable" Answer

"Three reasons:

**1. Mission Alignment** - I believe AI should *do the work*, not just suggest it. Durable's DIFY vision is exactly that - you're not building another website builder, you're building the platform that makes business ownership accessible.

**2. Impact Scale** - 6M businesses is massive reach. The features I build here could help hundreds of thousands of entrepreneurs actually succeed.

**3. Product Challenge** - Moving from website builder to full business platform is a fascinating product problem. It requires understanding user psychology, AI capabilities, and business strategy. That's exactly the kind of challenge I want to tackle.

Plus, James's post about 'last business I'll build' shows this is a founder who's all-in. I want to work with people who care that deeply."

---

## The "Why You" Answer

"I'm the PM who builds before asking. Most candidates tell you what they'd do - I show you.

I have:
- ✅ AI product experience (Chegg launches, Aspria Studio)
- ✅ 0-to-1 capability (proven at Varafy, currently building startup)
- ✅ Data-driven approach (A/B testing, analytics, user research)
- ✅ Growth mindset (100K users in <1 month, 63% conversion boost)
- ✅ Cross-functional leadership (eng, design, legal, marketing)

But most importantly: I care deeply about building products that genuinely help people succeed. Not features for features' sake - real impact."

---

## Closing Strong

### If They Ask "Any Questions?":

### Your Closing Statement:
"I'm really excited about this opportunity. I've spent a lot of time thinking about Durable's product and mission, and I genuinely believe I can help you get to that vision of making business ownership easier than having a job. These three features are just the beginning - I have a dozen more ideas I'd love to explore with your team. Thank you for your time today."
