# Durable Local: Testing & Validation Plan

## Pre-Build Validation

### Goal: Confirm users actually want this and will use it

### User Interviews (2 weeks)
**Participants:** 15 current Durable users
- 5 plumbers/HVAC technicians
- 5 photographers/videographers  
- 5 other service businesses (cleaning, landscaping, contractors)

**Selection Criteria:**
- Active Durable customers (paying for 3+ months)
- 1-6 employees
- Serve local area only
- Currently struggling to get customers online

**Interview Questions:**
1. How do people currently find your business?
2. When you search for [your service] in [your city], do you show up? Where?
3. What have you tried to improve your online visibility?
4. If we could automatically get you to the top 3 on Google, what would you be willing to do?
5. Show dashboard mockup: What makes sense? What's confusing?
6. Which features would you actually use weekly?

**Success Criteria:**
- 10+ users express strong interest ("I'd use this every week")
- 12+ users say they'd pay $10-20/month extra for this
- Users can explain the dashboard without help

---

### Competitive Research (1 week)
**Analyze:**
- BrightLocal (pro SEO tool)
- Yext (enterprise local listings)
- Moz Local (mid-market)
- GoDaddy Local SEO

**Questions:**
- What do they charge?
- What features do they include?
- What do users complain about in reviews?
- Where are the gaps Durable can fill?

**Key Finding to Validate:**
Most competitors are either too expensive ($100+/month) or too complex for small businesses. Durable can win by being simple + affordable.

## Beta Testing (4 weeks)

### Phase 1: Internal Testing (Week 1)
**Goal:** Find obvious bugs and UX issues

**Participants:** 5 Durable team members

**Test Plan:**
1. Complete onboarding flow
2. Use dashboard for 1 week
3. Complete all priority tasks
4. Document any confusion or bugs

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero critical bugs
- Onboarding takes <5 minutes
- All automations run successfully

---

### Phase 2: Closed Beta (Weeks 2-4)
**Goal:** Validate real-world effectiveness

**Participants:** 50 users
- Mix of industries (20 plumbing/HVAC, 15 photography, 15 other)
- Mix of tech comfort levels
- All serve local areas
- All have complete Durable websites

**Selection:**
- Manually recruited (email to active users)
- Free access for 90 days
- Required: Weekly check-ins with us

**What We're Testing:**
1. **Onboarding:** Can users complete setup without help?
2. **Engagement:** Do they use the dashboard weekly?
3. **Task Completion:** Do they complete priority tasks?
4. **Results:** Do rankings actually improve?
5. **Satisfaction:** Would they pay for this?

**Data We'll Collect:**
- Onboarding completion rate
- Weekly active users
- Tasks completed per user
- Ranking changes (before/after)
- Time to first Top 10 ranking
- Customer inquiry changes (self-reported)
- NPS score

**Weekly Check-ins:**
- 10-minute call with each user
- What's working? What's confusing?
- What results are you seeing?
- What features are missing?

**Success Criteria:**
- 70%+ complete onboarding
- 50%+ are weekly active
- 30%+ achieve Top 10 ranking in 90 days
- 40%+ report more customer inquiries
- NPS score >40
- 60%+ say they'd pay $10-20/month for this

**Failure Triggers (Stop/Pivot):**
- <40% complete onboarding → UX is too complex
- <20% weekly active → feature isn't valuable enough
- <10% improve rankings → SEO approach isn't working
- NPS <20 → fundamental product issue

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Users don't see results fast enough
**Mitigation:**

- Show progress weekly (ranking movements, even small)
- Highlight quick wins (directory listings, reviews)

### Risk: Technical issues with API integrations
**Mitigation:**
- Build fallbacks for each API
- Manual intervention option for first 100 users
- Clear error messages + support contact

### Risk: Users don't complete priority tasks
**Mitigation:**
- Make tasks dead simple
- Show impact of each task clearly
- Send email reminders
- Reward task completion (badges, progress bars)
