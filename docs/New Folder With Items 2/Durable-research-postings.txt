James Clift - Founder @ Durable

About
I've owned and operated companies since high school, from home services to SaaS.


Despite never having had a real job, I helped millions of people build their careers as CEO of VisualCV.com - bootstrapping it to 7 figures in profit and a successful exit in 2020.


Durable is the last business I'll build.


Our mission is to make owning a business easier than having a job.


We're building the first AI powered platform that enables anyone in the world to start and grow a successful business in minutes. We launched the first and fastest AI website builder in 2022 (before ChatGPT), that has enabled millions of business owners to get online in less than 30 seconds.


Our ambition goes far beyond websites, and we've raised $20 million to tackle that mission.


My job is to build a team that can make this vision a reality.


Humble yet fiercely ambitious people, please connect.

About
I've built inbound engines that 10x'd revenue and now drive 95% of new business. Currently building Durable's go-to-market as we expand from website builder to full AI-powered platform for entrepreneurs.


My approach to growth and marketing is simple: look at the numbers to find problems, then get creative about fixing them. My teams run dozens of experiments monthly – many miss, but the ones that work become repeatable growth playbooks. With AI, we test even faster. Models generate variations at scale, humans decide what's worth pursuing.


I build teams that move fast and learn faster through radical clarity on outcomes (not outputs), full autonomy on the path forward, and real-time metrics that keep everyone aligned. When the whole team sees the same scorecard, momentum becomes self-sustaining.


When building and developing teams, I look for people who:
-Genuinely care about customer problems (you can teach someone SEO, you can't teach empathy)
-Get excited about getting better – they own problems instead of passing them along
-Ask 'why' and 'what if' constantly, especially when things break
-Work for more than just the paycheque – they believe in what we're building


The best marketers today have impeccable taste and know how to scale it with AI. My teams use models for rapid iteration – first drafts, data analysis, competitive research – while humans provide the strategic thinking and creative polish that leads to true differentiation. This approach has cut our content production time by 60% while improving performance metrics.


What I've learned managing multi-million dollar budgets: constraints create better marketing than unlimited resources. When you can't throw money at problems, you're forced to actually solve them. The scrappiest teams often outperform the biggest budgets – they just move faster and think sharper.


I also believe great work happens when teams genuinely enjoy what they're building together. The best ideas come from people that trust each other enough to play with possibilities, challenge assumptions, and celebrate both wins and things that didn't work. That's the kind of environment where breakthroughs happen.


Recent Post (6 days ago)


I’ve been at Durable for 2 months, and I’m still amazed at how fast the team builds. Product and engineering ship daily – new capabilities, better UX, more ways to remove the complexity that keeps talented people stuck in jobs instead of running their own businesses. It’s a true PLG company where product moves fast and the mission makes sense and matters.


We're evolving from the no. 1 AI website builder to a full-stack platform that handles all the business tasks entrepreneurs don't want to do, don't have time for, or aren't sure how to do. I'm hiring two marketing pros/growth hackers to help us tell that story, reach more customers, and match the pace of product development.


ROLE 1: Referral & Growth Partnerships


Own the channels where buying decisions actually happen – before prospects ever visit our website. That means LLM responses (ChatGPT, Gemini), review sites (G2, Trustpilot), Reddit threads, affiliate programs, comparison articles, and anywhere entrepreneurs research business tools.


You’ll scale our referral program, recruit affiliates, get us featured in “best of” lists, and make sure we’re the answer when people ask “how do I start a business?”


ROLE 2: Senior Content Marketer (Performance Content)


Own words that turns visitors into customers. You’re an AI power user who uses advanced techniques like meta prompting and LLM daisychaining to 10x output across channels without sacrificing quality.


Most importantly, you have impeccable taste. You instantly spot the difference between AI slop and copy that makes someone pull out their credit card. You write conversion-focused copy for web and ads, and craft compelling long-form content that ranks in both Google and AI platforms like ChatGPT.


Who thrives in these roles:


You lead with empathy — it’s how you understand customers well enough to craft messaging that actually connects and drives action. You use AI to eliminate repetitive work and as a thought partner that challenges your assumptions. You’re data-driven – you live for the dopamine hit of watching performance metrics respond to your tests. When a playbook doesn’t exist, you create one. You ask forgiveness, not permission, when you spot growth opportunities.


If this sounds like you, please apply directly (links to both roles in the comments). Strong PMF means your work will have immediate impact on real growth 🚀 🚀

Our mission at Durable is to make owning a business easier than having a job.
Durable builds AI that does the work for you. Our goal is to own the DIFY (Do It For You) small business category.

We believe in a world where everyone is a business owner. Whether it's a full-time, part-time, or side hustle - we want to make it frictionless to start and operate a business.
