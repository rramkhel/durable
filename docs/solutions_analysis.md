## What We're NOT Building (and Why)

### Social Media Management
**Why not:** Different skill set, different use case. Local SEO is about being found on Google when someone needs you NOW. Social is brand-building.

### Paid Advertising (Google Ads)
**Why not:** Different budget model. We're focused on organic visibility. PPC is a separate product.

### Custom Website Design
**Why not:** Durable already solves this. We're optimizing what exists, not rebuilding.

### Multi-Platform SEO (Bing, Yahoo)
**Why not:** 92% of local searches happen on Google. Focus there first.

### Call Tracking/Recording
**Why not:** Privacy concerns, technical complexity, limited value for most users. Could be Phase 3 add-on.
