About Durable: 

Our mission at Durable is to make owning a business easier than having a job.

Durable builds AI that does the work for you. Our goal is to own the DIFY (Do It For You) small business category.

What is DIFY? It is a new category of technology that is faster and more cost effective than a human, and much easier to use than software. It is an AI first approach to solving customer problems.

You don't need to learn new software. You don't need to read help docs. You don't need to learn how to prompt. You provide business context and feedback, and the work is done for you.

We believe in a world where everyone is a business owner. Whether it's a full-time, part-time, or side hustle - we want to make it frictionless to start and operate a business. Since launching in late 2022, over 5 million websites have been built with our AI powered website builder. We are generating significant revenue, well-funded by Silicon Valley investors, and growing extremely fast.

Our vision is much bigger, and we're looking for incredible people to join our team and make an impact.

What You'll Do: 

As a Product Manager at Durable, you’ll shape the strategy, define product requirements, and drive execution across AI-native products that help small business owners succeed.

You’ll work across a highly collaborative, cross-functional pod—including engineering, design, data, and customer experience—to bring ideas to life and ensure they deliver real impact. From early research to post-launch iteration, you’ll own the full product lifecycle.

Key Responsibilities:

Lead product strategy and execution for new and existing features across Durable’s platform
Work closely with leadership and your team to define clear goals and roadmap priorities
Deeply understand our users—what they need, what they struggle with, and what excites them
Collaborate across engineering, design, data, and customer teams to ship high-impact features
Champion product quality, ownership, and accountability throughout the dev lifecycle
Use AI tools to create prototypes, explore ideas, and inform decision-making
Stay plugged into the evolving AI landscape and incorporate relevant advancements into the roadmap
Build strong alignment across internal teams and external stakeholders
What we’re looking for: 

Minimum requirements 

Proven experience in product management (ideally in fast-paced or startup environments)
Technical background (e.g., Computer Science degree or equivalent experience)
Strong product instincts and a user-first mindset
Excellent communication skills, both written and verbal
Comfortable with ambiguity, autonomy, and fast-moving environments
Highly collaborative with the ability to influence without authority
Curious, creative, and eager to push the boundaries of applied AI
Preferred qualifications

Impactful experience as a PM at a high-growth startup
Strong hands-on experience in full-stack or AI/ML engineering
A track record of launching successful products from 0→1
Prior experience building AI-powered tools or experiences
