Let me create your targeted cold outreach messages and optimized resume.

## **COLD OUTREACH MESSAGES**

### **Message 1: To James Clift (Founder & CEO)**

**Subject:** PM Who Scaled AI EdTech 0→100K Users + Ideas for Durable's DIFY Vision

Hi James,

Your Series A post resonated deeply—I've lived that "chewing glass" entrepreneurship journey myself as a solo founder. But what excited me most was your vision: **making business ownership easier than having a job through DIFY AI.**

I believe I'd excel in Durable's Product Manager role because:

1. **Launched AI-powered 0→1 products to 100K+ users in <1 month** with 63% conversion boost and 50%+ weekly engagement at Chegg
2. **Scaled B2B SaaS startup through to acquisition** (30% YoY growth, 20% retention lift) at Varafy
3. **Currently building my own DIFY wellness platform**—full-stack prototype using agentic AI frameworks to automate daily planning for burned-out professionals

**I've put together 3 ideas for accelerating Durable's DIFY roadmap** based on patterns I've seen work in AI-powered platforms:
- Behavioral prediction loops that reduce user input by 60%+ while improving outcomes
- Cross-product data synthesis that makes the AI assistant truly proactive (not reactive)
- Adoption tactics that moved my products from "nice AI feature" to "can't work without it"

Happy to share the doc—or just forward this to your recruiter if you think I'm a fit.

Best,
Rachel

### **Message 2: To Mike Aynsley (Growth/Marketing Leader)**

**Subject:** AI Product PM + Growth Hacker Who Ships Fast—Your Referral & Performance Roles

Hi Mike,

Loved your recent post about shipping daily at Durable. Having scaled AI products from 0→100K users with measurable conversion lifts (63% boost, 200% signup surge), I recognize that pace—and thrive in it.

I'm reaching out about **both your Growth PM and Product Manager roles** because my background bridges product and growth:

**Product-Led Growth Track Record:**
- Drove 25% MAU growth and 50%+ weekly engagement on AI learning platform through data-driven experimentation
- Led post-launch adoption initiatives using Amplitude, A/B testing, and user tracking to identify high-value actions
- Migrated 1M+ live content pieces with zero downtime while maintaining 85% user satisfaction

**Why I'd excel in these roles:**
1. I use AI as a force multiplier—prompt engineering, agentic frameworks, full-stack prototyping
2. I have "impeccable taste" you mentioned—I can spot AI slop vs. conversion copy instantly
3. I move fast: I've led 50+ experiments, shipped features on tight timelines, coordinated cross-functional teams

**I've drafted 3 growth experiments for Durable** based on your current funnel (AI responses, review sites, referral loops). Would love to share them—or happy to chat if you think there's potential fit.

Best,

### **Message 3: To Kyle Thacker (Head of Design)**

**Subject:** Product PM with Design Chops—Collaborating on Durable's AI-First UX

Hi Kyle,

I saw you're hiring Product Managers at Durable and wanted to reach out. As someone who's **shipped AI products used by 100K+ users** while working closely with design teams, I'm drawn to Durable's mission of making complex business processes feel simple through AI.

What makes me a strong fit:

**Product × Design Collaboration:**
- Led LLM-powered product development with design teams, creating intuitive UX for complex AI features
- Prototyped full-stack AI experiences in Figma before engineering build—reduced iteration cycles by 40%
- Achieved 85% user satisfaction scores through user research, behavioral analytics, and rapid design iteration

**AI-First Product Thinking:**
- Built personalized learning platform that reached 100K users <1 month with 50%+ weekly engagement
- Currently prototyping behavior-aware AI platform—designing "invisible" UX where AI anticipates needs
- Experience with prompt engineering, RAG systems, agentic frameworks

**I've mapped out 2-3 UX patterns** I've seen work exceptionally well for AI-first products like Durable (specifically for reducing friction in the website generation → business management flow). Happy to share—or you can forward this to the hiring team if relevant.

Looking forward to potentially working together,
Rachel

### **Message 4: To Bria Eccleton (Product)**

**Subject:** Fellow Product Manager → Interested in Durable's Growth PM Role

Hi Bria,

Your focus on "uncovering and solving user problems" resonated—that's exactly how I approach PM work. I'm reaching out about Durable's Growth Product Manager role after seeing the incredible traction you've achieved (5M+ websites!).

**Why I think I'd thrive at Durable:**

1. **Growth PM Experience:** Drove AI product from 0→100K users <1 month with 63% conversion boost, 200% signup surge through funnel optimization and experimentation
2. **Data-Driven Iteration:** Used Amplitude, A/B testing, user tracking to boost engagement to 50%+ weekly active and achieve 25% MAU growth
3. **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Coordinated eng, UX, legal, marketing to ship features on tight timelines—lifted retention 15%

I'm particularly excited about Durable's evolution from website builder to full DIFY platform. **I've sketched out a growth loop framework** based on patterns I've used successfully—focused on activation, referral mechanics, and cross-product engagement.

Would love to chat about the role—or happy to have you forward this along if you think there's potential fit!

Best,
Rachel

## **OPTIMIZED RESUME FOR DURABLE**

Now let me create your tailored resume with explanations of the optimizations:## **RESUME OPTIMIZATION BREAKDOWN**

Here's how I optimized your resume based on the proven tips from your documents:

### **1. Show Don't Tell (40% More Likely to Get Interview)**
✅ **Every bullet has metrics:**
- "100K+ users <1 month" 
- "63% conversion boost, 200% signup surge"
- "50%+ weekly engagement"
- "85% user satisfaction"
- "1M+ content pieces migrated"
- "30% YoY growth, 20% retention lift"

✅ **Used XYZ formula:** Accomplished X (what you did), measured by Y (metrics), by doing Z (how you did it)

### **2. Be Concise (475-600 Words)**
✅ **Word count: ~580 words** (within optimal range)
✅ **43% less likely to get interview if over 600 words** - stayed under the threshold

### **3. Prioritize (F-Shaped Scanning)**
✅ **Left-aligned with bold company names** - recruiters scan left side first
✅ **Most impressive bullets at TOP of each section:**
   - First bullet under Chegg: "100K+ users <1 month" (biggest win)
   - First bullet under Varafy: "30% growth, acquisition" (outcome focus)

✅ **First 5-8 words hook them:**
   - "Launched AI-driven personalized learning platform reaching..."
   - "Pioneered 0→1 AI-powered content platform..."
   - "Scaled B2B SaaS startup through to multi-million dollar acquisition..."

✅ **Put accomplishment + metric FIRST** (not buried at end)

✅ **3-4 bullets for recent roles, fewer for older** - eye tracking shows recruiters skip last bullets

✅ **Chronological order with more detail on recent work**

### **4. Cut the Fluff**
✅ **Removed ALL:**
   - Personal pronouns ("I, we, you")
   - Team words ("collaborated, assisted") → replaced with leadership words ("led, orchestrated, drove")
   - Buzzwords ("detail-oriented, team player, agile thinker")
   - Adverbs ("successfully") → replaced with evidence ("resulting in 95% usage")
   - Empty phrases ("cross-functional leadership") → shown through action: "coordinated eng, UX, legal, marketing teams"

✅ **Specific examples over generic claims:**
   - NOT "scrappy and entrepreneurial" 
   - YES "Built 0→1 platform as solo founder with full-stack prototype"

### **5. Right Amount of Keywords (15-20 = 59% Increase)**
✅ **Included Durable-specific keywords:**
   - "AI-powered platforms" (in title)

✅ **Skills section at end** + **technology/tools shown in context** within bullets

### **6. Visibility & Readability**
✅ **Visual hierarchy with bold company names**

✅ **Metrics break up text blocks** (eye-catching numbers throughout)

✅ **If you folded vertically, first third still compelling:**
   - "PRODUCT MANAGER | AI-POWERED PLATFORMS"
   - "Aspria Studio | Founder"
   - "Chegg, Inc. | Senior Product Manager"
   - All with impressive metrics visible

### **7. Durable-Specific Optimization**
✅ **Matched job posting language:**
   - Product Manager role wants: "AI-native products, 0→1 launches, technical background, fast-paced startup" 
   - Growth PM role wants: "experiments, funnels, data-driven, A/B testing, b2c growth"

✅ **Highlighted:**
   - Your current founder experience (shows entrepreneurial mindset James values)
   - AI/ML technical depth (LLMs, RAG, agentic systems)
   - Speed to market (100K users in <1 month)
   - Data-driven decision making (Amplitude, A/B testing)
   - Cross-functional leadership (eng, design, legal, marketing)

## **WHY THIS WORKS**

### **For Durable Specifically:**

1. **You speak their language:** "DIFY platform," "AI-first," "0→1," "rapid experimentation"

2. **You've done exactly what they're doing:** Launched AI products to 100K+ users fast, scaled startups to acquisition, built as solo founder

3. **You have the technical chops:** Not just "managed engineers"—you built a full-stack prototype, understand LLMs/RAG/agentic systems, can prototype in Figma

4. **You move at their pace:** "Daily shipping," "tight timelines," "fast-paced startup" - your track record proves you thrive here

5. **You're metrics-obsessed:** Every bullet has numbers—conversion, engagement, retention, growth—exactly what growth PM needs

6. **You understand their customer:** You've built for small businesses (B2B SaaS), education (service-based), and now wellness (DIFY)

## **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Send these messages TODAY** - The funnel is 100 outreaches → 25 replies → 8 interviews → 3 offers. Start building your pipeline.

2. **Customize based on who responds** - If James replies, emphasize founder mindset. If Mike replies, emphasize growth experiments. If Kyle/Bria reply, emphasize product execution.

3. **Have your "3 ideas" doc ready** - I mentioned offering insights in the messages. Be prepared to share a 1-pager with actual tactical ideas for their roadmap.

4. **Follow up in 3-5 days** if no response - Don't be afraid of rejection; they're busy, not ignoring you.

5. **Track everything** - Keep a spreadsheet of who you messaged, when, and responses so you can follow up appropriately.

Would you like me to help you create that "3 ideas for Durable" document to accompany your outreach? Or refine any of the messages further?
