Subject: A PM's Take on 3 AI Features for Durable

Hi Bria,

I hope you're well today! I'm Rachel, a PM focused on high growth AI work, and I'm reaching out because I'm really interested at working as a PM at Durable and contributing to the DIFY mission. I saw that you're looking for someone who tests and learns quickly, obsesses over user experience, and is experienced crafting elegant, native AI solutions that solve real user problems. I think I'd be a great fit because:

1. I drove AI product from 0→100K users <1 month with 63% conversion boost, 200% signup surge through funnel optimization and experimentation
2. I used Amplitude, A/B testing, user tracking to boost engagement to 50%+ weekly active and achieve 25% MAU growth
3. I'm currently prototyping a full stack productivity and habit science platform for touchless calendaring and life planning, a fully automated DIFY experience similar to Durable's.

I did a quick prototype exploring some potential growth features that could be really valuable possibilities for Durable: durable-phi.vercel.app/

If you think I could be a fit, would you mind forwarding this along to the recruiter? I’m also happy to jump on a call to see if it’s the right fit.

Best,
Rachel
